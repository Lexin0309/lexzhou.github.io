Data Science B.Sc. Junior student at the Valencia Polytechnic University ([UPV](http://www.upv.es/)). Machine Learning Research Collaborator at [Biomedical Data Science Lab - ITACA](https://www.bdslab.upv.es/). AI Research Collaborator at [Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence - VRAIN](https://vrain.upv.es/). My main research and academic interest encompasses several areas of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Healthcare, Algorithmic Fairness and Robustness, Data Science, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, and AI evaluation.

Recent Highlights
======

* One paper under revision process (with a major revision) at [JMIR public health and surveillance](https://publichealth.jmir.org/): [*Subphenotyping of COVID-19 patients at pre-admission towards anticipated severity stratification: an analysis of 778 692 Mexican patients through an age-gender unbiased meta-clustering technique*](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.21.21252132), 2021.

* One conference paper at [Mathematical Modelling in Engineering & Human Behaviour 2021](https://www.imm.upv.es/jornadas/2021/home.html):  [*A population-based study of COVID-19 patient’s survival prediction and the potential biases in machine learning*](https://jornadas.imm.upv.es/proceedings/Modelling2021.pdf).

* Main researcher of [**SUBCOVERWD-19**](http://www.itaca.upv.es/projects_page/single-projects/) with [Biomedical Data Science Lab](https://www.bdslab.upv.es/), [INCLIVA Health Research Institute of Valencian Clinic Hospital](https://www.incliva.es/) and [Research Institute of the University Hospital 12 de Octubre de Madrid i + 12](https://imas12.es/) under the supervision of Prof [Carlos Sáez Silvestre](http://personales.upv.es/carsaesi/#about); a data science project where we build a novel, fair and robust AI Clinical Decision Support System using ML that facilitates the prognosis and estimation of the evolution of patients with COVID-19, at the time of hospital admission or ICU admission.
Currently, in this project, I am conducting two pieces of research regarding (1) unbiased subphenotypes discovery in Spanish COVID-19 ICU patients based on blood test patterns  that facilitate early risk stratification and (2) algorithmic unfairness evaluation toward developing robust methodology in predicting the survival of COVID-19 patients. 
The project is having a great media coverage at, e.g., [El Independiente](https://www.elindependiente.com/futuro/2020/08/04/desarrollan-un-sistema-de-ia-para-pronostico-personalizado-de-afectados-covid-19/), [La Vanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/valencia/20200804/482675943882/un-nuevo-sistema-de-inteligencia-artificial-facilitara-el-pronostico-y-la-evolucion-de-los-pacientes.html), [Pharma Market](https://www.phmk.es/i-d/nuevo-sistema-de-inteligencia-artificial-facilitara-el-pronostico-y-evolucion-del-covid-19), [Santander Bank](https://www.santander.com/en/stories/the-supera-covid-19-fund-eur-85-million-to-tackle-coronavirus-in-spain) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFAx1dFhXu8).  

* Research Collaborator of [**OCDE “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Skills”**](https://www.oecd.org/education/ceri/) at [Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vrain.upv.es/) (with collaboration scholarship) under the supervision of Prof [José Hernández-Orallo](http://josephorallo.webs.upv.es/); a international project where I collaborate with other outstanding AI scientist fellows to evaluate different AI technologies in different domains: image classification, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, etc. The project is having an extraordinary [media coverage](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_esES918ES918&tbm=nws&sxsrf=AOaemvJyQQjJ8qEeNu7Zg_njAqxBUu6cww:1640518127488&q=OECD+Artificial+Intelligence+and+the+Future+of+Skills&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiE5vGhroH1AhWvz4UKHWtfDM0QgwN6BAgVEAE&biw=1421&bih=1021&dpr=1.21).
