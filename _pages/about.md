Data Science BSc Junior student at the Valencia Polytechnic University ([UPV](http://www.upv.es/)). Machine Learning Research Collaborator at [Biomedical Data Science Lab - ITACA](https://www.bdslab.upv.es/). AI Research Collaborator at [Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence - VRAIN](https://vrain.upv.es/). My main research and academic interest encompasses several areas of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Health, and Data Science.

Recent Highlights
======

* One paper under revision process (with a major revision) at [JMIR public health and surveillance](https://publichealth.jmir.org/): [*Subphenotyping of COVID-19 patients at pre-admission towards anticipated severity stratification: an analysis of 778 692 Mexican patients through an age-gender unbiased meta-clustering technique*](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.21.21252132), 2021.

* One conference paper at [Mathematical Modelling in Engineering & Human Behaviour 2021](https://www.imm.upv.es/jornadas/2021/home.html):  [*A population-based study of COVID-19 patient’s survival prediction and the potential biases in machine learning*](https://jornadas.imm.upv.es/proceedings/Modelling2021.pdf)

* Main researcher of [**SUBCOVERWD-19**](http://www.itaca.upv.es/projects_page/single-projects/) with [Biomedical Data Science Lab](https://www.bdslab.upv.es/), [INCLIVA Health Research Institute of Valencian Clinic Hospital](https://www.incliva.es/) and [Research Institute of the University Hospital 12 de Octubre de Madrid i + 12](https://imas12.es/) under the supervision of [Prof Carlos Sáez Silvestre](http://personales.upv.es/carsaesi/#about); a data science project in respect of Severity Subgroup Discovery and Classification on COVID-19 Real World Data through Machine Learning and Data Quality assessment where we build a novel AI Clinical Decision Support System using ML that facilitates the prognosis and estimation of the evolution of patients with COVID-19, at the time of hospital admission or ICU admission. The project is having an extraordinary media coverage at, e.g., [El Independiente](https://www.elindependiente.com/futuro/2020/08/04/desarrollan-un-sistema-de-ia-para-pronostico-personalizado-de-afectados-covid-19/), [La Vanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/valencia/20200804/482675943882/un-nuevo-sistema-de-inteligencia-artificial-facilitara-el-pronostico-y-la-evolucion-de-los-pacientes.html), [Pharma Market](https://www.phmk.es/i-d/nuevo-sistema-de-inteligencia-artificial-facilitara-el-pronostico-y-evolucion-del-covid-19), [Santander Bank](https://www.santander.com/en/stories/the-supera-covid-19-fund-eur-85-million-to-tackle-coronavirus-in-spain) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFAx1dFhXu8).  

* Research Collaborator of [**OCDE “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Skills”**](https://www.oecd.org/education/ceri/) at [Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vrain.upv.es/) (with collaboration scholarship) under the supervision of Prof [José Hernández-Orallo](http://josephorallo.webs.upv.es/), a international project where I receive intensive training in collaborating with other outstanding AI scientist fellows to evaluate different AI technologies in different domains: image classification, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, etc. Specifically, the training focuses on improving (i) the ability to analyze scientific-technical articles on evaluation and understand what each test measures and the evaluation metrics used, (ii) data integration and multidimensional aggregation using different result formats according to Github or similar repositories, and (iii) critical spirit when comparing state-of-the-art in artificial intelligence technologies.
